<h4> ROMEO AND JULIET </h4>
<img src="aa.jpg" alt="Romeo and Juliet" height="260" width="190"><br>
<span><i><strong>Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
Whole misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br></strong><i></span>

<p><big>There is a musical about that book and "Les Rois Du Monde" is one of the known song.</big></p>
